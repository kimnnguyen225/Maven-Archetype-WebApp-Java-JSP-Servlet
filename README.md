### Audience

This guide is intended to provide a how-to guide for beginner Software Developers. 

### Nice to have, before you start:

- IDE, I'm using IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (paid) 2019 version, so all of the screenshots and modules, settings, etc are based off IntelliJ IDEA but you can Google search for similar options/functions/locations of libraries, etc in your choice of IDE. But IntelliJ IDEA is super-est IDE in my opinion with exposed experience with other IDEs.
- Basic knowledge or familiar with war and war_exploded of IntelliJ
- Java JDK, I'm using 12.0.1 version
- Basic knowledge of Tomcat server, I'm using 9.0.19 version. You can use other open-source application server of your choice, i.e. GlassFish, JBoss, Payara...
- Basic knowledge of how to create JSP/Servlet as you would with Java EE
- Helpful if have basic knowledge with MVC (Model View Controller - Database DAO SQL Utility - UI - Controller/Servlets)
- Helpful if you know what pom.xml is, it's a file that you declares your dependencies for your project

This is just a guide to help you learn how to create a Maven archetype webapp, it does not guide you how to create any project example/ sample from start to finish.
